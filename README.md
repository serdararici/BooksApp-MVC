# üìö Books App - ASP.NET Core MVC Book Management Application

A full-stack web application for book and category management, built with ASP.NET Core MVC and .NET 8. The project features layered architecture, authentication, CRUD operations, and responsive UI. Created as a learning project by following a comprehensive YouTube tutorial.

## üîç Overview

Books App is a role-based web application designed with clean architecture principles. It includes two user roles: **Admin** and **Customer**.

- **Admin** can manage categories and products (books) with full CRUD functionality.
- **Customer** can view the product list in a clean and user-friendly interface.

The project integrates **authentication and authorization**, **Entity Framework Core**, and a **layered architecture** to demonstrate a production-like backend structure. It also includes a modern responsive UI using **Bootstrap**, as well as user interaction enhancements with **Toastr** notifications and **TinyMCE** rich text editor.

## üõ† Technologies & Tools

- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8)
- **Language:** C#
- **Database:** MS SQL Server
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication & Authorization:** ASP.NET Identity
- **UI Framework:** Bootstrap 5
- **Text Editor:** TinyMCE (for product description)
- **Notifications:** Toastr.js
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022

## üß± Architecture

The project follows a clean, modular, and scalable architecture:

- **Layered Structure:**
  - `Models` ‚Äì Application models like `Category`, `Product`, and `ApplicationUser`.
  - `DataAccess` ‚Äì Contains DB context (`ApplicationDbContext`), repositories, and interfaces.
  - `Utilities` ‚Äì Helper classes and constants.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - **Repository Pattern** ‚Äì For abstracting data access.
  - **Dependency Injection** ‚Äì Used throughout the project (e.g., Singleton services).

- **ASP.NET MVC Features:**
  - **Areas:** Admin and Customer areas separate business logic and views.
  - **CRUD Operations:** Implemented for both `Category` and `Product` entities.
  - **Role-Based Access Control:** Admins manage data; customers view products only.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database
The application uses MS SQL Server as its database and integrates it via Entity Framework Core using Code-First approach.

- Custom ApplicationDbContext handles the connection and database logic.

- Identity tables are included by default for user authentication and role management.

- The main application tables include:

  - **Categories**

  - **Products**

  - **ApplicationUsers**

Entity relationships are set up through navigation properties. Each product belongs to a category, and the admin user can perform all data operations on these entities via the admin panel.

üì∑ Below is a snapshot of the database structure (as viewed from SQL Server Management Studio):
